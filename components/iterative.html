      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Iterative design is a process that creates better products based on
        continuous feedback from users and stakeholders. My team designed an interactive mobile prototype for Retrofit,
        a startup.
        <br><br>
        As the vintage and secondhand market grows, its online
        marketplace has become more overwhelming. Retrofit's solution is
        an AI-curated vintage marketplace, which uses social media
        trends, sales data, and a user's style to personalize a user's
        shopping experience.

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p>
        We created mobile application mock-ups from our sketches, reflecting a design that is both convenient and
        user-friendly.

      <h2>Hi-fi Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        After receiving feedback from a stakeholder, we used Figma to design a hi-fi prototype, making some changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added checkout, search results, and brand specific screens</li>
        <li>Created add to cart and percent match informational popups</li>
        <li>Added private/public distinction to profile page</li>
        <li>Changed grid on home page to sectioned recommendations</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="testing">
      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Users tested our design by searching for an item and
        completing the checkout process.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users found the interface very intuitive due to its similarity to other shopping interfaces.</li>
        <li>
          Users were able to easily find the correct buttons/interactive components to press to work through the task.
        </li>
        <li>Some users were confused when searching so a next step would be to add a keyboard to the prototype.</li>
        <li>
          Some users didn't like the persistent popup when adding an item to cart, so a next step would be replacing it
          with a banner at the
          top of the app, allowing the user to continue their shopping momentum.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Through our iterative design process, we developed an intuitive, user-centric mobile app for Retrofit. By
        incorporating
        user feedback as much as possible, we created an interface that effectively integrates AI-curation into a
        seamless
        browsing and purchasing experience.
